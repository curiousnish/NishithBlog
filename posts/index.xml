      <description>An article written by an eight year old PC to help it‚Äôs successors lead a better life.
Windows 11 is on the horizon and most of the people are excited to get a worthy update, but not every PC in the market is eligible for Windows 11 upgrade (not even a 3 year old hardware) due to some security requirements which Microsoft thinks are crucial for running Windows 11. So, we have to run Windows 10 till these requirement issues are sorted out.</description>

      <description>An article on free tools and a roadmap to start learning Data Science/ Machine Learning with no programming experience.
Disclaimer This article reflects my thoughts and experience of pursuing Data Science. I am not a big fan of overly priced MOOCs or online courses and their promise of becoming a successful Data Scientist within months or weeks. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, these courses can help you with the basic idea of what is Data Science, and the technologies used but they will never be able to make you a master nor will you be able to get good high paying jobs based solely on these courses.</description>
