The recruiters are not interested in courses you completed, but they are more interested in projects.\nIn my opinion, if you want to master the art of Data Science, you must be able to dedicate a huge amount of time for practicing and trying different things out.

So to learn Data Science, you must know how to handle data, and the tools you‚Äôll need to analyze and gain insights from the data.\nRoadmap Following are the things you need to cover:\n Googling ‚Äî Literally, How to google! Mathematics ‚Äî Linear algebra, Basic Statistics, and Vectors and Matrices Programming Machine Learning/Data Science Visualization ‚Äî Tableau or Power BI Projects and Journey ahead  Let‚Äôs start:\n1. Googling üòÇ Got a CV today and the guy literally listed one of his skills as ‚Äògoogling‚Äô We‚Äôre interviewing him\n‚Äî Cat McGee (@CatMcGeeCode) July 23, 2021  Few days ago, I read a tweet from a recruiter stating that they are interviewing a candidate who mentioned ‚ÄúGoogling‚Äù as one of the skills in his CV. Finding the best answers on internet will help you learn things faster and more efficiently than any online course. There are many people who have already had the same doubts as you in the past and the community is so vast and open minded that you can find answers to almost anything for free.\n2. Mathematics üò® Don‚Äôt be afraid, we just need to know some basics to get started.\n Linear algebra and Matrices‚Äî Watch this YouTube Playlist from 3Blue1Brown.  That‚Äôs it, you can leave all the higher level concepts (calculus, differential equations) for the future (2 to 3 years).\n3. Programming ‚Äî fun starts now! ü§© There are mainly two programming languages that are common in the community for Data Science ‚Äî Python and R. Each one has its own huge list of pros and cons. The main difference which helped me choose Python over R; ‚ÄúPython can be integrated well with Web Apps and Mobile Apps for easy deployment‚Äù.\n For Python ‚Äî Watch this YouTube Playlist from TheNewBoston, and read ‚ÄúAutomate the Boring Stuff with Python‚Äù book by Al Sweigart.  4. Machine Learning ‚Äî the best part üéâ  Machine Learning by Stanford University and taught by Andrew Ng ‚Äî The course uses Octave to teach programming concepts, but no one uses it these days. So to get most out of it, try to implement the same exercises in python. Follow Machine Learning Mastery blogs.  5. Visualization ‚Äî cherry on the cake üç∞ Most of the end users and stakeholders don‚Äôt understand the different machine learning metrics (F1-score, Area under curve, True Positive and True Negatives, Mean Squared Error) but they properly understand graphs or Dashboards. So, a Data Scientist must be able put forward his insights in the form of Dashboards. There are mainly three tools used for this purpose:\n Python Visualization ‚Äî Matplotlib, Seaborn or Plotly (interactive) Tableau ‚Äî My favorite and easy to learn. Power BI ‚Äî More advanced Business Intelligence tool with too much flexibility and customization  To best way to learn any of these tools, find some Datasets and get started with visualizations. Also, there are very detailed documentations on each tool and vast community.\n6. Projects ‚Äî move past tutorials üê±‚Äçüèç Interviewers and companies want to see your work and the energy and knowledge you put in it, they are not interested in the courses. So after knowing the basics of Programming and Machine Learning you should get started with Projects, easy ones, like Housing Price Prediction, Simple Classification, etc.\nBonus For free tutorials on almost anything in python (including but not limited to Machine Learning, Self Driving, Web App Development), visit\nPythonProgramming.net\nThis is just the beginning‚Ä¶\nHope this article helped you to get started with Data Science.\nBest of luck!\n","wordCount":"855","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?ixlib=rb-1.2.1\u0026ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026w=1170\u0026q=80","datePublished":"2021-08-01T08:30:00+05:30","dateModified":"2021-08-01T08:30:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nishith"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nishithblog.ml/posts/2021-08-01-getting-started-with-data-science/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nishith","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nishithblog.ml/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
