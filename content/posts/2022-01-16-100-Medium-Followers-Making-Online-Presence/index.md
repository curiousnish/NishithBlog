Hey Readers!
Happy New Year 🎉 and Let’s make this year count!

I wish everyone a great year ahead and may you never stopping dreaming!

Every year I make some resolutions to become a better version of myself. Past years have been difficult for all us and these goals help me keep moving forward. Here are some of my previous year’s resolutions and their final outcome (Spoiler: I’m not perfect):

1.  Read 30 books 📖(ended up reading 28 books)
2.  Start writing blogs 📝(just wrote 2 blogs last year)
3.  Learn to cook 🫕 (learnt some dishes, but still far away from making a complete meal)
4.  Build a PC with my own money 🖥️(One of the best things happened in 2021)

This year’s resolution will be  challenging and I need help from you guys. I made a resolution to have an **online presence** and gain new friends/followers along the journey. For the first two weeks, I worked on my personal [**website**](https://nishithchoudhary.ml/) and [**blog**](https://nishithblog.ml/). It’s not perfect, but it’s a progress towards my goal. The next step is to gain some followers and deliver quality content to the audience. This is where Medium comes to the rescue.

You may know about the [Medium Partner Program](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Getting-started-with-the-Partner-Program) and the eligibility requirement of **100 followers**. I recently came across a trend of **“follow for follow”** to gain those 100 followers fast. But I’m not here for the **Partner Program**, as even if I’ll get 100+ followers, I won’t be able to enroll because of some Geo-restrictions. So this article is about reaching out to the world and make initial steps towards my goal.

Here’s how you could help me:

1.  **Check out the** [**articles**](https://medium.com/@nishithchoudhary) I’ve already published and if you find it interesting, **please follow me** 💕
2.  **Introduce yourself** in the comments of this article. You can simply write: “Hi, my name is \_\_\_. I’m writing about \_\_\_, or my interests are \_\_\_.” I’ll be happy to follow and know you!
3.  Connect with me on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/its__nishith) or [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishithchoudhary/)

Little Introduction about me:

Hey, I’m a 23 years old **Engineer**, who did **MBA (Master of Business Administration) in Finance** and working as an **Associate Consultant** in Deloitte. I love talking about technology, gaming and life. In my spare time, I play games, build things, cook, cycling, read books, and write. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with my friends and now I’m trying to give it to a larger audience. I will be writing about Technology, Data Science, Computers, Work and Life-related stuff. And in the future, I’ll target to reach a greater audience.
