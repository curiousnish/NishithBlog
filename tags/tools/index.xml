      <description>An article on free tools and a roadmap to start learning Data Science/ Machine Learning with no programming experience.
Disclaimer This article reflects my thoughts and experience of pursuing Data Science. I am not a big fan of overly priced MOOCs or online courses and their promise of becoming a successful Data Scientist within months or weeks. Donâ€™t get me wrong, these courses can help you with the basic idea of what is Data Science, and the technologies used but they will never be able to make you a master nor will you be able to get good high paying jobs based solely on these courses.</description>
