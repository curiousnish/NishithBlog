This article won’t bore you with the stats of the most used programming language in a year or the languages that recruiters or companies prefer, because in order to get a great Data Science job, one must know both languages to some extent and really master one of the two.
This article will try to help you to choose the language to start with or the one to master.</description>

      <description>An article on free tools and a roadmap to start learning Data Science/ Machine Learning with no programming experience.
Disclaimer This article reflects my thoughts and experience of pursuing Data Science. I am not a big fan of overly priced MOOCs or online courses and their promise of becoming a successful Data Scientist within months or weeks. Don’t get me wrong, these courses can help you with the basic idea of what is Data Science, and the technologies used but they will never be able to make you a master nor will you be able to get good high paying jobs based solely on these courses.</description>
