[{"content":"All of us have some kind of side hustles/projects that we want to be a part of our lives. It may include writing a book/blog, reading, learning, exercising and the list goes on. But due to our full time work/college life, we don’t always get time to invest in ourselves and work towards our goals.\nI used to wake up at 5 a.m. during my childhood days, because our school started at 7 and my school bus would come at the stop at around 6 because the school was 12 kilometers away from my house and it took around 30 minutes to reach the destination. This was a start of a habit, I’m still grateful of.\nBut as I grew old, somethings changed and I was deprived of this habit and had to start new. For years, I had read about how people like Tim Cook, Benjamin Franklin, Richard Branson, Oprah and so many other highly successful people had one thing in common, they woke up early. All this motivated me to get back on track and make peace with my long lost habit.\nInitial days were pretty rough. I would always think of getting up early in the morning while planning to sleep but something would always come up…\n I would stay up late playing games (“Just one more game”) I was tempted by the snooze button (Snooze gets the bigger, colored button) My bed was too warm and cozy. It was raining out (we can’t win against nature). It was cold out (the most loved thing is the blanket). It was hot out. And on and on and on…  …and would sleep till half of the day is vanished 😴.\nUgh.\nSo what changed?\nHow I found my way back to my old habit and made peace with the long lost love?\nHere’s how I did it…\nBefore Sleeping… 1. Go to bed early Every article, video and podcast started with this line and I’m not really a fan of this. I go to bed between 11 to 11:30 and this has never stopped me from getting up early. The important thing here to note is that I take 1 or 2 naps of around 20 minutes during the day which helps me focus and removes all the laziness during the work. Now this approach is not possible for everyone and may not work for others, but this is a game of experiment and try to schedule your day to get a good 7 to 8 hours of sleep.\nIf I was not able to take those precious naps during the day, then I would make sure to go to sleep at 10. So, you gotta try for yourself the different methods that your body can adapt to.\n2. Create a Bedtime routine The most crucial part of achieving this goal is to make a proper bedtime routine. Before going to sleep, you must do some routine work which will prepare your body and mind for the sleep that will be coming soon. Through trial and error, I found out some of the things that worked for me and it may work for you as well…\n Try to read some pages of your favorite book, selecting a genre was the most important thing for me as I have imagination level similar to that of a child. I would create an imaginary world from the things described in the books so horror books are a big no for me. I would suggest reading motivational/personal development books, fictional comedy or autobiographies if you don’t want your mind to wake you up in the middle of night either scared or thinking about weird things. No screen time for 1 hour before going to sleep (screens are the monsters that frighten our eyes from darkness) Don’t get into a fight with partner or family members or be in an angry mood before sleeping as it will distract your mind towards the things you would have done differently that would have avoided this situation Don’t eat right before going to bed as will create different types of problems other than ruining your sleep. If we continue to sleep right after eating, we tend to gain weight and our health deprecates faster (a big no for those trying to lose weight) No News before bed AT ALL COSTS. During pandemic, all news channels were covered with deaths, tension, uncertain future and so on. News is an important part of our lives, but it’s not helpful before going to bed. Sometimes, I had woken up in the middle of night covered in sweat with a heart rate of about 100–120 bpm to a nightmare of seeing my loved ones disappear from my lives (try to avoid bad news before sleeping)  Lastly, try to think of all the things, projects or activities that you will be doing the next morning after getting up early. Make a list, write on a post-it note, do whatever it takes to get you motivated to move out of the bed.\n3. Waking Up (The most difficult part) and way ahead It is the most painful part and it has the highest Failure Rate for obvious reasons 😉.\nI have always found myself getting up early because of the things I planned to do in the morning and the level of satisfaction it will grant. I would build projects, write code, study data science, write blogs, go for cycling, exercise and the list goes on increasing. Try to find the things you love and will help you grow and try to complete them in the morning.\nAfter getting up, try to move as soon as possible, get out of bed, find some water, heat it (drinking warm water in the morning is the most healthiest thing) and Get Things Done😎!\n And, before you know it, it will be time to go to bed again.\nGood Luck 👍!\n","permalink":"https://nishithblog.ml/posts/2022-01-24-how-i-get-up-at-4-30/","summary":"All of us have some kind of side hustles/projects that we want to be a part of our lives.

Past years have been difficult for all us and these goals help me keep moving forward. Here are some of my previous year’s resolutions and their final outcome (Spoiler: I’m not perfect):\n Read 30 books 📖(ended up reading 28 books) Start writing blogs 📝(just wrote 2 blogs last year) Learn to cook 🫕 (learnt some dishes, but still far away from making a complete meal) Build a PC with my own money 🖥️(One of the best things happened in 2021)  This year’s resolution will be challenging and I need help from you guys. I made a resolution to have an online presence and gain new friends/followers along the journey. For the first two weeks, I worked on my personal website and blog. It’s not perfect, but it’s a progress towards my goal. The next step is to gain some followers and deliver quality content to the audience. This is where Medium comes to the rescue.\nYou may know about the Medium Partner Program and the eligibility requirement of 100 followers. I recently came across a trend of “follow for follow” to gain those 100 followers fast. But I’m not here for the Partner Program, as even if I’ll get 100+ followers, I won’t be able to enroll because of some Geo-restrictions.

There were a lot of articles, YouTube videos and book references for the pros and cons of the 2 languages, but this article will help you choose the one to get started.\nWhy I chose Python as starter. After devoting long hours in the search for the best programming language I decided to go with Python and these were the reasons I chose it:\n  Easy to read syntax and beginner friendly (every article started with this line)\n  It has a huge library of packages (not a selling point, even R has a competitive set of packages)\n  Can be used to create ML applications using Flask, Django, TensorFlow lite and Streamlit etc. (I’m sold)\n  I always wanted to make apps using Machine Learning and this was the main point of choosing Python as a starter.\nVerdict — What should you choose? Different ML practitioners have different opinions on choosing the started language, but my suggestion would be to start with python as a starting point and try to learn the foundational concepts of Machine Learning. Later on, try to implement the learned concepts using R.\nIt is important to have a basic idea about both the languages as you will be working in teams and the language of choice will be decided based on the majority. Also, this will help you to learn some new concepts and techniques specific to the language.\nBonus Here’s a bonus tip on the choosing the language based on the role you are targeting. It is often noticed and experienced that R is preferred in the field of Research and Python for the rest of the use cases. So if you are trying to make a career in Research, then R may be a good choice otherwise start with Python.\n","permalink":"https://nishithblog.ml/posts/2022-01-02-python-vs-r/","summary":"What programming language to choose for Data Science and Machine Learning.\nThis article won’t bore you with the stats of the most used programming language in a year or the languages that recruiters or companies prefer, because in order to get a great Data Science job, one must know both languages to some extent and really master one of the two.\nThis article will try to help you to choose the language to start with or the one to master.","title":"Python Vs. R… long lasting debate simplified"},{"content":"An article written by an eight year old PC to help it’s successors lead a better life.\nWindows 11 is on the horizon and most of the people are excited to get a worthy update, but not every PC in the market is eligible for Windows 11 upgrade (not even a 3 year old hardware) due to some security requirements which Microsoft thinks are crucial for running Windows 11. So, we have to run Windows 10 till these requirement issues are sorted out.\nAbout Me: I am an eight year old Dell all-in-one PC running second generation Intel core i3 with 4 GB ram (DDR3) and still running Windows 10 and able to handle all the daily tasks. That’s it with my intro, let’s get to the juicy part\u0026hellip;\nMaking your PC faster To improve the performance of a Windows PC, you need to ask your owner to follow some steps:\nStep 1: Format/Reset/Refresh your PC (even if it’s brand new) The best way to get rid of all the non-required applications that are buried deep down the OS is to reset the PC. Nowadays, it easy to Reset a PC without losing data. So got for it!\nThis guide will help you reset the PC properly.\nStep 2: Uninstall apps you don’t use (there are a ton of bloatware) After resetting the PC or installing a fresh copy of Windows 10, we are now ready to clean it even more, because there are a lot of preloaded apps (bloatware) that comes with the installation of windows. We can uninstall most of the apps by navigating to Settings \u0026gt; Apps \u0026gt; Apps \u0026amp; Features, and selecting the apps which we don’t need and can be uninstalled.\nIn my case, if I see an “Uninstall” button, I’ll click it.\nMost of the users will be pretty happy with the performance increase after doing these 2 steps, but if you want more performance then the next step can help you achieve that.\nStep 3: Use Windows 10 De-bloater This step is not required, but if done properly can give you up to 10–20% boost in performance. Warning! – Perform this step at your own risk to squeeze the last bit of performance from you PC.\nIn this step, we’ll be using a program called Windows10Debloater developed by Richard Newton (Sycnex). It is a powerful script and can be used to remove any system apps including Microsoft Store, Photos app and so on.\nThe steps are pretty simple…\n Visit Sycnex/Windows10Debloater Download the zip file of the code Extract the zip file Run the “Windows10DebloaterGUI.ps1”: to run this program, right click the file and select “Run With PowerShell” This will open the window for running the scripts and disabling some unwanted stuff from Microsoft. These are the buttons I click after running the script:   Credits —Richard Newton (Sycnex) is an awesome guy to provide these scripts for free and open sourcing the project. Much love to him and the team that made it possible.\n","permalink":"https://nishithblog.ml/posts/2021-08-08-making-windows-faster/","summary":"An article written by an eight year old PC to help it’s successors lead a better life.\nWindows 11 is on the horizon and most of the people are excited to get a worthy update, but not every PC in the market is eligible for Windows 11 upgrade (not even a 3 year old hardware) due to some security requirements which Microsoft thinks are crucial for running Windows 11.

I am not a big fan of overly priced MOOCs or online courses and their promise of becoming a successful Data Scientist within months or weeks. Don’t get me wrong, these courses can help you with the basic idea of what is Data Science, and the technologies used but they will never be able to make you a master nor will you be able to get good high paying jobs based solely on these courses. The recruiters are not interested in courses you completed, but they are more interested in projects.\nIn my opinion, if you want to master the art of Data Science, you must be able to dedicate a huge amount of time for practicing and trying different things out. You need a lot of motivation to get started but you need a greater amount of discipline to stay on the path of learning. I have a lot friends/colleagues who dropped the idea of pursuing Data Science because of no sudden benefits and lack of patience and discipline.\nA quote by James Clear in Atomic Habits helped me a lot\n Success usually comes down to choosing the pain of discipline over the ease of distraction.\n What is Data Science According to Wikipedia,\n Data science is a “concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods” in order to “understand and analyze actual phenomena” with data.\n In simple terms, Data Science is the art of gaining insights from the data. So to learn Data Science, you must know how to handle data, and the tools you’ll need to analyze and gain insights from the data.\nRoadmap Following are the things you need to cover:\n Googling — Literally, How to google! Mathematics — Linear algebra, Basic Statistics, and Vectors and Matrices Programming Machine Learning/Data Science Visualization — Tableau or Power BI Projects and Journey ahead  Let’s start:\n1. Googling 😂 Got a CV today and the guy literally listed one of his skills as ‘googling’ We’re interviewing him\n\u0026mdash; Cat McGee (@CatMcGeeCode) July 23, 2021  Few days ago, I read a tweet from a recruiter stating that they are interviewing a candidate who mentioned “Googling” as one of the skills in his CV. Finding the best answers on internet will help you learn things faster and more efficiently than any online course. There are many people who have already had the same doubts as you in the past and the community is so vast and open minded that you can find answers to almost anything for free.\n2. Mathematics 😨 Don’t be afraid, we just need to know some basics to get started.\n Linear algebra and Matrices— Watch this YouTube Playlist from 3Blue1Brown.  That’s it, you can leave all the higher level concepts (calculus, differential equations) for the future (2 to 3 years).\n3. Programming — fun starts now! 🤩 There are mainly two programming languages that are common in the community for Data Science — Python and R. Each one has its own huge list of pros and cons. The main difference which helped me choose Python over R; “Python can be integrated well with Web Apps and Mobile Apps for easy deployment”.\n For Python — Watch this YouTube Playlist from TheNewBoston, and read “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python” book by Al Sweigart.  4. Machine Learning — the best part 🎉  Machine Learning by Stanford University and taught by Andrew Ng — The course uses Octave to teach programming concepts, but no one uses it these days. So to get most out of it, try to implement the same exercises in python. Follow Machine Learning Mastery blogs.  5. Visualization — cherry on the cake 🍰 Most of the end users and stakeholders don’t understand the different machine learning metrics (F1-score, Area under curve, True Positive and True Negatives, Mean Squared Error) but they properly understand graphs or Dashboards. So, a Data Scientist must be able put forward his insights in the form of Dashboards. There are mainly three tools used for this purpose:\n Python Visualization — Matplotlib, Seaborn or Plotly (interactive) Tableau — My favorite and easy to learn. Power BI — More advanced Business Intelligence tool with too much flexibility and customization  To best way to learn any of these tools, find some Datasets and get started with visualizations. Also, there are very detailed documentations on each tool and vast community.\n6. Projects — move past tutorials 🐱‍🏍 Interviewers and companies want to see your work and the energy and knowledge you put in it, they are not interested in the courses. So after knowing the basics of Programming and Machine Learning you should get started with Projects, easy ones, like Housing Price Prediction, Simple Classification, etc.\nBonus For free tutorials on almost anything in python (including but not limited to Machine Learning, Self Driving, Web App Development), visit\nPythonProgramming.net\nThis is just the beginning…\nHope this article helped you to get started with Data Science.\nBest of luck!\n","permalink":"https://nishithblog.ml/posts/2021-08-01-getting-started-with-data-science/","summary":"An article on free tools and a roadmap to start learning Data Science/ Machine Learning with no programming experience.\nDisclaimer This article reflects my thoughts and experience of pursuing Data Science.
